title: Drawing shapes to canvas in React
tags: ["react", "canvas"]

I built a database designer web app because why not? And the biggest challange so far has been the workbench/canvas component for drawing database tables. TL,DR: I went with [ReactFlow](https://reactflow.dev).

## Preface

I didn't bother with canvas while teaching myself javascript because it seemed like an easy enough concept. Well i still think its an easy concept, but as with everything related to javascript, it has its challanges.

## Canvas and React

First of all react and canvas is not a good match. Manipulating the dom with refs feels weird, what am i a vanilla js guy? In hindsight going vanilla js route would save me some trouble.
